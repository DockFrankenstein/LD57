## Collision layers

In order not to go insane, I've created this list of all the collision layers that I use and what they are for.
* Layer 0 - level geometry
* Layer 1 - player and all player related things
* Layer 2 - toggable invisible walls
* Layer 3 - movable level geometry
* Layer 4 - big object collision
* Layer 5 - NPC

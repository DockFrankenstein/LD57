VAR speaker = "???"
VAR jeremy = "Jeremy Wattson"

Have you seen {jeremy}?
No matter.
Reel in an object using the crank and pick it up from the hole.

~ speaker = "You"
Why?

~ speaker = "???"
So that it won't be in the hole.

~ speaker = "You"
(You question the meaning of life.)
(But you stop, because it isn't your job to do that.)
(Neither is this.)
(But you don't mind.)

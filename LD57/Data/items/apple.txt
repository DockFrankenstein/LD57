You got Apple!
It's so rare to actually know how an apple will taste like before eating it. There are so many types that are secretly swapped out when you aren't looking. In a way, apples are the most untrustworthy memories you can have. You like apples, but which one? How does an apple taste like? Do you know? Perhaps you can know in the moment, but memories can't fully reconstruct what already happened. We only get to know how an apple tastes like in these very short moments when we sit down and eat them. You don't know anything about apples. And they do not know anything about themselves.

You got Friend!
I wonder, do I have friends, or am I borrowing them? I mean, they probably don't know about me, but they feel like friends. If you think about it, most friends don't fully know much about their friends. They could, but they don't. It's a weird game, which I never understood. I'm not saying it's wrong, but it's just not for me. But I will try breaking it's rules if I ever get the chance.

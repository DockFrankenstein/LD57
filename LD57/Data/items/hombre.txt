You got Hombre!
Isn't it fun to make friends with animals? They do not have such high requirements as other people, you can tell them everything you want and they can't say no. But if I don't care about real friends, than what is the point of talking to an animal? There are better ways of talking, such us music or drawing. On the other hand, these things also require some abstraction and pretending... but an animal? Hombre is the best!
